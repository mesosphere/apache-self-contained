 USAGE: ./util (run_apache)?
        ./util bundle

  In the first form, runs the bundled Apache binary. In the second form,
  bundles the system Apache for transfer to another system.

  To invoke the first form, calling ./util with no arguments is sufficient; it
  is the default subcommand.

 run_apache

  Launch the bundled Apache (which is ./httpd). We ensure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  points to the local lib directory, so that bundled libs are discovered and
  used in preference to system libs.

 bundle

  Bundle an installed Apache and its shared libraries so that they can be
  deployed as a unit.
 
  To use this function, first install Apache with Yum. Then call:
 
    sudo ./util bundle
 
  The system Apache will be inspected to find its shared library dependencies,
  which will be copied in to ./lib. Apache modules will be placed in ./modules.
  The system Apache binary will also be copied to ./.
